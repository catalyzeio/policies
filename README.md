# Luma HIPAA Compliance Policies

Luma helps relieve the challenges of patient communication and engagement with our HIPAA-compliant messaging platform for healthcare.

HIPAA compliance really has two halves. The first half includes all technical guidelines, both physical and digital. Compliant companies take measures to secure their hardware and manage their software in a certain way. Encryption, logging, monitoring—these are just a few examples of HIPAA technical requirements. Luma builds its platform with these guidelines in mind.

The second half of HIPAA is focused on administrative and organizational activities. This includes signing Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), and managing company policies like training, among other things. Crafting company policies that align with HIPAA administrative guidelines are straightforward, but an immense burden.

## How we created these policies? 

As a company who handles PHI, it's critical we maintain and publish your own policies. HIPAA compliance is complicated, but it doesn't have to be. In order ao assure the utmost completeness of our policies, we have adopted policies from an industry leader in HIPAA compliance [Datica](htts://datica.com), healthcare's trusted HITRUST CSF Certified digital health platform.
