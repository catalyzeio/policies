# WatchTower HIPAA Compliance Policies

This repository maintains the policies and related documentation that together form WatchTower's compliance infrastructure 
for the handling and management of electronic Protected Health Information.  In its initial implementation, this framework 
is focused on compliance with guidelines stipulated by HIPAA.  

This framework will be extended to address other relevant compliance models such as HITRUST or PCI, as well as specific 
data security requirements mandated by our Customers and Partners.
