# Vulnerability Scanning Policy

Bind is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. Bind utilizes [Threatstack](https://www.threatstack.com) to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities on our systems. We also utilize [Threatstack](https://www.threatstack.com/) on all systems, including logs, for file integrity checking and intrusion detection.

## Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

## Vulnerability Scanning Policy

* Threatstack management is performed by the Bind Security Officer with assistance from the VP of Engineering.
* Threatstack is used to monitor all internal systems on Bind networks.
* Frequency of scanning is performed in real time by agents installed on production instances.
* Reviewing Threatstack reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, are the responsibility of the Bind Security Officer.
* In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:
	* All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
	* Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer, VP of Engineering, and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by Bind.
		* Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
		* Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the Bind Risk Assessment Policy.
* All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by Bind.
* Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the Bind vulnerability management policy.
	* External penetration testing is performed bi-annually by a third party. TODO: need to choose a vendor.
	* Internal penetration testing is performed quarterly. TODO: what are we going to use to do this?
	* Gaps and vulnerabilities identified during penetration testing are reviewed, with plans for correction and/or mitigation, by the Bind Security Officer.
	* Penetration tests results are retained for 6 years by Bind.
* This vulnerability policy is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer.
