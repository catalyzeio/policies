# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Luma understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Luma is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Luma has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Luma Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws

##  18.2 Data Retention Policy

* Current Luma Customers have data stored by Luma as a part of the Luma Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
  2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days or as defined appropriate based on Customer response, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is given option to get an extract of data.
  3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Luma within 30 days, Luma removed data from Luma systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
