# 3. Policy Management Policy

CareJourney implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The Security Officer and Privacy Officer are responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all CareJourney workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.

## 3.1 Applicable Standards

### 3.1.1 Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

* 12.c - Developing and Implementing Continuity Plans Including Information Security

### 3.1.2 Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.316(a) - Policies and Procedures
* 164.316(b)(1)(i) - Documentation

## 3.2 Maintenance of Policies

1. All policies are stored and updated to maintain compliance with HIPAA, HITRUST, and other relevant standards.
2. Policies must be stored within the CareJourney GitHub account, using version control and a Pull Request (approval) process for all changes. 
3. The following process must be used for all policy changes:
   1. Changes may be proposed at any time by any employee.
   2. All changes must be approved by both the Privacy Officer and Security Officer.
   3. Policy changes are not considered to take effect until the necessary approvals have been provided and the associated Pull Request is merged (closed).
   4. Unapproved policies may be rejected outright or re-worked for further consideration. 
4. All policies must be available to all employees.
   * Changes shall be automatically communicated to all employees through integrations between GitHub and Slack that log all GitHub policy changes.
   * Significant changes are communicated by the Security Officer via email. These emails include a high-level description of the policy change using terminology appropriate for the target audience.
5. Policies must be reviewed and audited annually, as well as after significant changes occur to the organzation or to the ePHI Secure Environment. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by CareJourey management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The process for reviewing polices is outlined below:
  1. The Security Officer initiates the policy review by creating an Issue in the CareJourney Issue Management System.
  2. If changes are made, the above process is used. Rationale for changes are documented in the Issue.
  3. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer creates a Pull Request for all changes for final review by relevant stakeholders.
  4. If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required and merging the Pull Request.
6.  CareJourney utilizes the HITRUST MyCSF framework to track compliance with the HITRUST CSF on an annual basis. 
  1.  The Security Officer initiates the HITRUST audit activity by creating an Issue in the CareJourney Issue Management System.
  2.  The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to own and manage the HITRUST activity.
  3.  Once the HITRUST activity is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue.
  4.  If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
  
Additional documentation related to maintenance of policies is outlined in [ยง5.3.1](#5.3-security-officer).
