# 17. 3rd Party Policy

WatchTower makes every effort to assure all 3rd party organizations are compliant and do not compromise the integrity, security, and privacy of WatchTower or WatchTower Customer data. 3rd Parties include Customers, Partners, Subcontractors, and Contracted Developers.

## 17.1 Applicable Standards

### 17.1.1 Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.314(a)(1)(i) - Business Associate Contracts or Other Arrangements

## 17.2 Policies to Assure 3rd Parties Support WatchTower Compliance

1. WatchTower does not allow 3rd party access to production systems containing ePHI.
2. All connections and data in transit between the WatchTower Platform and 3rd parties are encrypted end to end.
3. A standard business associate agreement with Customers and Partners is defined and includes the required security controls in accordance with the organization's security policies. Additionally, responsibility is assigned in these agreements.
4. WatchTower has Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with Subcontractors with an agreed service arrangement addressing liability, service definitions, security controls, and aspects of services management.
   * Subcontractors must coordinate, manage, and communicate any changes to services provided to WatchTower.
   * Changes to 3rd party services are classified as configuration management changes and thus are subject to the policies and procedures described in [ยง8](#8.-configuration-management-policy); substantial changes to services provided by 3rd parties will invoke a Risk Assessment as described in [ยง3.2](#3.2-risk-management-policies).
   * WatchTower utilizes monitoring tools to regularly evaluate Subcontractors against relevant SLAs.
5. No WatchTower Customers or Partners have access outside of their own environment, meaning they cannot access, modify, or delete anything related to other 3rd parties.
6. WatchTower maintains and annually reviews a list all current Partners and Subcontractors.
   * The list of current Partners and Subcontractors is maintained by the WatchTower Security and Privacy Officer, includes details on all provided services (along with contact information), and is recorded in [ยง1.4](#1.4-WatchTower-organizational-concepts).
   * The annual review of Partners and Subcontractors is conducted as a part of the security, compliance, and SLA review referenced below.
7. WatchTower assesses security, compliance, and SLA requirements and considerations with all Partners and Subcontractors. This includes annual assessment of SOC2 reports for all WatchTower infrastructure partners.
   * WatchTower leverages recurring calendar invites to assure reviews of all 3rd party services are performed annually. These reviews are performed by the WatchTower Security Officer and Privacy Officer. The process for reviewing 3rd party services is outlined below:
     1. The Security and Privacy Officer initiates the SLA review by creating an Issue in the WatchTower Project Management System.
     2. The Security and Privacy Officer, or Privacy Officer, is assigned to review the SLA and performance of 3rd parties. The list of current 3rd parties, including contact information, is also reviewed to assure it is up to date and complete.
     3. SLA, security, and compliance performance is documented in the Issue.
     4. Once the review is completed and documented, the Security and Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
8. Regular review is conducted as required by SLAs to assure security and compliance. These reviews include reports, audit trails, security events, operational issues, failures and disruptions, and identified issues are investigated and resolved in a reasonable and timely manner.
9. Any changes to Partner and Subcontractor services and systems are reviewed before implementation.
10. For all partners, WatchTower reviews activity annually to assure partners are in line with SLAs in contracts with WatchTower.
11. SLA review is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Project Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
12. The 3rd Party Assurance process is reviewed annually and updated to include any necessary changes.
13. Changes to the 3rd Party Assurance process will also be made on an ad-hoc basis in cases where operational changes require it or if the process is found lacking.
