# Facility Access Policy

Bind works with Subcontractors to assure restriction of physical access to systems used as part of the Bind Platform. Bind and its Subcontractors control access to the physical buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or in which Bind workforce members operate, in accordance to the HIPAA Security Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. Physical Access to all of Bind facilities is limited to only those authorized in this policy. In an effort to safeguard ePHi from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed to areas only to those persons authorized to be in them and with escorts for unauthorized persons. All workforce members are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized visitor and/or unauthorized access to Bind’s facility.

Of note, Bind utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in a HIPAA compliant fashion, and as a IaaS, AWS workforce members do not have ready access to ePHI, it provides cloud-based, compliant infrastructure to Bind. Bind does not physically house any systems used by its Platform in Bind facilities. Physical security of our Platform servers is outlined [here](https://aws.amazon.com/security/) and [AWS Security Whitepaper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) and [AWS Risk and Compliance Whitepaper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Risk_and_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf).  Bind limits it's AWS data center (region) use to US East
