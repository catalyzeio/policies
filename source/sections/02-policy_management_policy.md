# 2. Policy Management Policy

WatchTower implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The Security and Privacy Officer is responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all WatchTower workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific points in time.

   4. If the review is approved, the Security and Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
   5. If the policy change requires technical modifications to production systems, those changes are carried out by authorized personnel using WatchTower's [change management process (ยง8.4)](#8.4-changing-existing-systems).
4. All policies are made accessible to all WatchTower workforce members. The current master policies are published at [https://policy.watchtowerbenefits.com](https://policy.watchtowerbenefits.com).
   * Changes are automatically communicated to all WatchTower team members through integrations between GitHub and Slack that log all changes to the policy documentation.
   * The Security and Privacy Officer also communicates policy changes to all employees via email. These emails include a high-level description of the policy change using terminology appropriate for the target audience.

7. WatchTower utilizes the HITRUST MyCSF framework to track compliance with the HITRUST CSF on an annual basis. WatchTower also tracks compliance with HIPAA and publishes results at [https://hipaa.watchtowerbenefits.com](https://hipaa.watchtowerbenefits.com). In order to track and measure adherence on an annual basis, WatchTower uses the following process to track HITRUST audits, both full and interim:
